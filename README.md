Modular Task Manager
Welcome to the Modular Task Manager, a powerful, highly customizable application designed to help you organize your life with intelligent, predictive scheduling. This app goes beyond a simple to-do list by analyzing your schedule to warn you about potential time crunches before they happen.

Key Features
Intelligent Task Status: Tasks automatically change color (from Ready to Start Soon, Do Right Now, and Overdue) based on a predictive algorithm that considers not just the task's due date, but also the estimated duration of all your other high-priority tasks.

Deep Customization:

Custom Statuses: Edit the names and colors for each status to match your personal workflow.

Custom Categories: Create an unlimited number of color-coded categories to organize your tasks.

Theming Engine: Choose a base color to generate a dynamic, cohesive theme across the entire application, or stick with the default color scheme.

Advanced Repetition Engine: Schedule tasks that repeat on complex schedules, such as "the last Friday of every month" or "the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of January, March, and May."

Flexible Completion Tracking: Tasks can be simple check-offs, or they can require tracking progress by a target count (e.g., read 50 pages) or time spent (e.g., practice guitar for 30 minutes).

Failure Tracking: For repeating tasks, set a "max misses" threshold to track habits and get a clear visual indicator when a habit is at risk.

Interactive Calendar View: Visualize your scheduled tasks on a full-screen monthly or weekly calendar.

Project Roadmap & Future Updates
This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the Modular Task Manager.

Phase 1: Core Functionality & UX Polish
Fix Notifications: Investigate and debug the notification engine (script-part-5.js) to ensure users receive timely alerts for task status changes.

Responsive Calendar View: Refactor the CSS for calendar.html to ensure it displays correctly on all screen sizes. This will likely involve using media queries to adjust cell sizes and enabling vertical scrolling within day/week views to prevent layout breakage.

Customizable Task Cards: Implement a feature in "Advanced Options" allowing users to toggle the visibility of individual details on the task cards (e.g., Due Date, Repetition Info, Misses). This will allow for a cleaner, more minimalist UI for those who prefer it.

Accessibility (A11y) Audit: (My suggestion!) Review the application to ensure it is fully accessible to users with disabilities, including proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support (ARIA labels), and meeting color contrast standards.

Phase 2: Analytics & Deeper Customization
Task History & Analytics:

Modify the data structure to store a history of the last ~100 completions/misses for each repeating task.

Create a new "Charts" or "Analytics" page.

Use a library like Chart.js or D3.js to visualize data, such as completion vs. miss rates by task or category.

Data Portability (Import/Export):

Bulk Task Import: Implement a feature to import tasks from a user-provided JSON file. This is essential for power-users and for quickly populating the app with complex task lists (e.g., a complete workout routine generated by an AI).

Category Export: Allow users to export all tasks within a specific category to a JSON file. This serves as both a backup and a way to share task lists.

JSON Template: Provide a clear and simple JSON structure template for users. This template will guide them (and any AI they use) to format the data correctly for successful import. Note: This should be implemented after the core data structure is finalized to avoid frequent template updates.

Multiple Categories per Task: As part of this, investigate implementing the ability for a single task to belong to multiple categories.

Advanced calculateStatus Tuning:

Based on beta tester feedback, fine-tune the YELLOW_WINDOW_HOURS constant and other predictive logic.

Consider adding a user setting (e.g., "Warning Sensitivity: Low/Medium/High") that adjusts these time windows.

Explore alternative calculation models (e.g., a "priority score" based on more than just due dates).

Phase 3: Backend & Monetization
Database Integration: Transition from localStorage to a persistent database like Firebase Firestore. This is crucial to prevent data loss when a user's browser cache is cleared.

User Authentication: Implement a user account system to serve as the foundation for premium features.

Multi-Device Sync: Ensure that a user's tasks, categories, and settings are seamlessly synced across all their devices in real-time.

Collaborative Features: Allow users to share specific categories or tasks with friends, enabling collaborative task management.

Monetization: Introduce a premium tier (e.g., a small one-time fee for an account) to unlock features like multi-device sync and sharing.
