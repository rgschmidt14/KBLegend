Welcome to the Dynamic Task & Mission Planner, a powerful, highly customizable application designed to help you organize your life with intelligent, predictive scheduling and integrated planning. This app goes beyond a simple to-do list by analyzing your schedule, tracking your goals, and providing a clear visual interface to manage both your daily tasks and long-term missions.

## **In-Depth Features**

This application is built as a comprehensive tool for managing complex schedules and tracking progress towards specific goals. It combines a sophisticated task manager with a weekly mission planner, providing a single interface for all your planning needs.

### **The Task Manager**

The core of the application is a dynamic and intelligent task management system.

* **Intelligent Task Status:** Tasks automatically change color and status (Ready, Start Soon, Do Right Now, Overdue) based on a predictive algorithm. This system doesn't just look at the due date; it considers the estimated duration of all your other high-priority tasks to warn you about potential time crunches before they happen.  
* **Flexible Time Input:** Choose to define a task by its due date and time, or by its start time and estimated duration. The application will handle the calculations for you.  
* **Advanced Repetition Engine:** Create tasks that repeat on almost any schedule imaginable.  
  * **Relative Repetition:** Set tasks to repeat at an interval after their due date (e.g., "every 3 days").  
  * **Absolute Repetition:** Define complex schedules, such as "the last Friday of every month" or "the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of January, March, and May."  
* **Flexible Completion Tracking:** Choose how you want to complete a task.  
  * **Simple:** A standard check-off for simple to-do items.  
  * **Count-Based:** Track progress towards a numerical goal (e.g., read 50 pages, do 100 push-ups).  
  * **Time-Based:** Track time spent on a task with a built-in timer (e.g., study for 45 minutes).  
* **Habit & Failure Tracking:** For repeating tasks, you can set a "max misses" threshold. The task's status will change as you approach this limit, providing a clear visual indicator when a habit is at risk of being broken.  
* **In-Depth Customization:**  
  * **Task Icons:** Assign a unique icon to each task using Font Awesome classes for quick visual identification.  
  * **Customizable Task Cards:** From the Advanced Options menu, choose exactly which details you want to see on your task cards, such as due date, duration, category, and more.  
  * **Categories:** Create an unlimited number of color-coded categories to organize your tasks.  
  * **Status Names & Colors:** Edit the names and colors for each status (Ready, Overdue, etc.) to match your personal workflow.  
  * **Theming Engine:** Choose a base color to generate a dynamic, cohesive theme across the entire application, or stick with the default color scheme. You can also randomize the theme for a fresh look.  
* **Notifications:** Receive desktop notifications when a task's status changes, ensuring you never miss an important deadline. (Currently under development).

### **The Mission Planner**

Integrated directly with the task manager, the mission planner provides a high-level view of your week and long-term progress.

* **Seamless Task Creation:** Click directly on any time slot in the planner to instantly create a new one-hour task for that time.  
* **Repetition Projection:** Repeating tasks are automatically projected onto the planner, so you can see your future commitments at a glance.  
* **Historical View:** The planner maintains a 4-week history of completed and missed instances of your repeating tasks.  
* **Infinite Future View:** Scroll forward in the planner indefinitely in a read-only mode to see long-term projections.  
* **Weekly & Daily Views:** Plan your schedule on a traditional weekly grid or zoom in to a detailed daily view.  
* **Task Integration:** All tasks from the Task Manager with a due date will automatically appear on the planner grids.  
* **Custom KPIs:** Define and track your own Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Set daily goals and record your actual performance.  
* **5-Week Progress Tracker:** A visual chart tracks your performance on all your KPIs over the last five weeks.  
* **Amendment Tracking:** If you edit a past week's schedule, goals, or KPIs, the changes are flagged with an asterisk, ensuring an honest record.  
* **Seamless Week Advancement:** At the end of the week, a single click archives the current week and sets up a fresh week for planning.

## **Project Updates**

This section provides a high-level overview of the project's status, recent updates, and future plans.

### âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.7) - 09/22/2025

This update improves data management safety, enhances data portability, and continues the ongoing code refactoring initiative.

*   **Category Deletion Behavior:** Corrected the behavior of category deletion. It now deletes the category and all of its associated active tasks, as intended. A confirmation dialog warns the user of this action and clarifies that task history will be preserved.
*   **Enhanced Task Portability:** The "Export Tasks" feature has been improved. It now includes all relevant category data (colors, names) within the same file. The import process has also been updated to intelligently merge this category data, either adding new categories or updating existing ones to match the imported file, ensuring seamless transfer of tasks between different instances of the application.
*   **Code Refactoring:** The `renderTaskStats` function was refactored to use a dedicated template file (`js/templates.js`), separating its HTML structure from the core application logic. This continues the important work of making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

### âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.6) - 09/22/2025

This update introduces critical data management features and lays the groundwork for task analytics, improving data portability and user insight.

*   **Data Portability (Import/Export):**
    *   **Flexible Backups:** From the "Advanced Options" menu, users can now export their application data to a JSON file. This feature provides flexible backup options, allowing users to export all data or specific parts like tasks, categories, history, or settings.
    *   **Data Recovery:** Users can import data from a backup file, which will overwrite the current data and reload the application. This is crucial for data safety and recovery.
*   **Task Statistics Page:**
    *   **New Task View:** Clicking a task in the planner now opens a "Task View" modal, which provides a quick overview of the task's details.
    *   **Dedicated Stats:** From the "Task View," users can navigate to a dedicated statistics page that shows the task's completion rate, total completions vs. misses, and a detailed history of its activity. This provides users with valuable insights into their performance on individual tasks.

### âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.5) - 09/22/2025

This update improves accessibility and continues the ongoing effort to refactor the codebase for better maintainability.

*   **Advanced Options Button:** The "Advanced Options" panel, previously only accessible from within the Task Manager, can now be opened directly from the main application header. This provides users with quicker access to powerful customization features.
*   **Code Refactoring:** The `renderCategoryManager` function was refactored to use a dedicated template file (`js/templates.js`), separating its HTML structure from the core application logic. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

### âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.4) - 09/21/2025

This update improves the user experience of the task creation form by making it more intuitive and logical.

*   **Task Form Reorganization:** The fields within the "Advanced" section of the task modal have been restructured and grouped into logical categories:
    *   **Time & Scheduling:** All fields related to dates, duration, and scheduling are now grouped together.
    *   **Completion:** Contains options for defining what it means to complete a task (e.g., simple check-off, count, or time tracking).
    *   **Repetition:** All settings for recurring tasks, including the failure tracking options, are now consolidated in one place.
*   **Improved Cohesion:** This change makes the form less cluttered and easier to navigate, especially when creating complex, recurring tasks.

### âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.3) - 09/21/2025

This update refactors the main user interface to improve organization and pave the way for a dedicated dashboard.

*   **Dual-View Layout:** The main planner interface has been split into two distinct views:
    *   **Calendar View:** A focused view that contains the FullCalendar instance and all related time-management controls.
    *   **Dashboard View:** A new dedicated home for non-timed planning elements, including the "Mission Goals" and "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)".
*   **Improved UI Navigation:** Clear "Calendar" and "Dashboard" toggle buttons have been added to the main header, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the two views. This declutters the primary interface and creates a more intuitive user experience.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.2) - 09/21/2025**

This update is a major architectural enhancement that replaces the custom-built planner with the industry-standard **FullCalendar.io** library. This provides a more robust, feature-rich, and maintainable foundation for all future planner development.

*   **Modernized Planner View:**
    *   **FullCalendar.io Integration:** The old, custom-coded daily, weekly, and monthly planner views have been completely removed and replaced by a single, powerful FullCalendar instance.
    *   **Improved Maintainability:** This significantly simplifies the codebase by removing hundreds of lines of complex, hard-to-maintain rendering logic. The planner is now powered by a well-documented and professionally maintained library, making future updates easier and more reliable.
    *   **Enhanced UI:** The new calendar provides a more modern look and feel, smoother navigation, and a more professional user experience out-of-the-box.
    *   **Preserved Core Logic:** This change was carefully implemented to **only replace the rendering engine**. All of the app's unique, intelligent scheduling logic (like `calculateScheduledTimes`) remains untouched, ensuring the app's "smarts" are fully preserved.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.1) - 09/21/2025**

This update introduces a "Simple Mode" for the task creation form to improve the user experience, especially for new users.

*   **Simple Mode for Task Creation:**
    *   **New Toggle:** The task creation modal now features a "Simple/Advanced" toggle switch. By default, the form opens in "Simple Mode," showing only the most essential fields: task name and due date.
    *   **Clutter-Free UI:** This hides the numerous advanced options (like detailed repetition schedules, completion tracking, categories, etc.) from users who just want to quickly add a task, reducing initial overwhelm.
    *   **Smart Detection:** When editing an existing task that already uses advanced properties, the form will automatically open in "Advanced Mode" to ensure all settings are visible and editable.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 2.0) - 09/21/2025**

This is a major feature release that introduces a powerful new intelligent scheduling engine to the planner. The application can now automatically deconflict tasks to help users visualize their true schedule and avoid overbooking.

*   **Intelligent Task Scheduling:**
    *   **Automated Deconfliction:** The planner now automatically adjusts the start times of tasks that are marked as "requires full attention". If multiple such tasks have overlapping times, the less important tasks (determined by due date and miss count) are shifted earlier in the schedule to ensure they don't overlap. This provides a realistic visual representation of when work needs to begin to meet all deadlines.
    *   **UI for "Full Attention" Tasks:** The task creation and editing forms now have a clear checkbox labeled "This task requires my full attention". This flag is used by the new scheduling engine. The old, ambiguous "counts as busy" property has been renamed and refactored throughout the codebase for clarity.
*   **Robust Testing:** Added a comprehensive test suite for the new scheduling algorithm to ensure its reliability and prevent regressions under various conflict scenarios.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.9.1) - 09/20/2025**

This was a critical patch to fix major layout bugs in the planner views, making the application stable and usable again.

*   **Planner Rendering Engine Fix:** Overhauled the planner's rendering logic to resolve critical visual bugs.
    *   **Daily View Overhaul:** The Daily View, which was causing tasks to render over the main navigation controls, has been completely refactored. It now uses the same modern CSS Grid system as the Weekly View, ensuring a stable, predictable, and usable layout.
    *   **Weekly View Fix:** Corrected a bug in the Weekly View where task items would overflow the horizontal boundaries of their day column. Tasks now correctly respect their container's width, especially when multiple tasks overlap.
*   **Code Unification:** Both weekly and daily views now share the same underlying grid and rendering logic (`CSS Grid`), reducing code duplication and making future maintenance easier.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.9) - 09/20/2025**

This update introduces a core architectural enhancement to the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) system, making it more powerful and automated.

*   **KPI Frequency and Auto-Tasking:** The system now distinguishes between 'daily' and 'weekly' KPIs.
    *   **UI Update:** When creating a new KPI, you can now specify its frequency using a dropdown menu.
    *   **Automatic Task Generation:** The application will now automatically generate a new task every day for each KPI marked as 'daily'. This ensures you never forget to track your daily metrics and removes the need to create these tasks manually.
*   **Robust Testing:** Added a comprehensive test suite for the new auto-generation logic to ensure its reliability and prevent future regressions.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.8) - 09/20/2025**

This update focused on establishing a modern, professional development environment to improve the long-term robustness and maintainability of the application.

*   **Testing Framework:** Introduced **Jest** as a formal testing framework. This is a critical first step towards ensuring code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling developers to build new features with confidence.
*   **Unit Tests for Core Logic:** Wrote the first suite of unit tests for the `calculateStatus` function, which is a core piece of the application's "intelligent" task scheduling. These tests verify its behavior under multiple conditions.
*   **Code Modularization:** Refactored the monolithic `script.js` into smaller, more manageable modules (`js/task-logic.js` and `js/script.js`). This improves code organization and makes it possible to test individual components in isolation.
*   **NPM Integration:** The project is now managed with `npm`, allowing for easy installation of dependencies and the execution of development scripts (like running tests).

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.7) - 09/20/2025**

This update focused on improving the long-term robustness of the application and restoring key functionality.

*   **Task Archiving:** Implemented a critical architectural improvement to enhance performance. Completed or missed non-repeating tasks are now moved from the main `tasks` array to a `historicalTasks` array. This keeps the active task list lean, ensuring the application remains fast and responsive as more tasks are added.
*   **KPI Editability Restored:** Fixed a regression where Key Performance Indicator (KPI) goals and actuals were not editable in the Progress Tracker. The `disabled` attribute was removed from the inputs, allowing users to edit past KPI data again. The existing amendment tracking system correctly flags these changes to maintain a transparent record.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.6) - 09/20/2025**

This update focused on improving the visual consistency and user experience of the application by fixing theme-related bugs.

*   **Light Mode Theme Fix:** Corrected a visual bug where some elements in light mode had dark text on dark backgrounds, making them unreadable. This was resolved by removing hardcoded text colors from HTML elements and adding specific CSS rules to ensure all text has appropriate contrast against the background in both light and dark themes.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.5) - 09/20/2025**

This update focused on improving the long-term stability and maintainability of the application by addressing critical bugs and refactoring the planner's rendering engine.

*   **Planner View Rendering Overhaul:** Fixed a major visual bug in the **Weekly and Daily** planner views where concurrent tasks would overlap and become unreadable. The rendering logic was re-architected to use a modern **CSS Grid layout**. This replaces the old, brittle positioning logic with a robust system that correctly and automatically handles laying out tasks, ensuring the planner is stable and legible.
*   **Code Stability:** Refined the JavaScript rendering functions (`renderDailyView`, `renderWeeklyView`) to be simpler and more maintainable, directly supporting the new CSS Grid system.

### **ðŸ”œ Up Next: Pre-Database Features**

This section outlines the next set of features and improvements planned before the major architectural shift to a server-side database. The focus is on enhancing the user experience, improving code quality, and adding value to the current single-user version of the application.

*   **Continue HTML Refactoring:** Continue the refactoring of the application to separate HTML from JavaScript. Good progress has been made with `js/templates.js`, and several components (`renderCategoryManager`, `renderNotificationManager`, `renderTaskStats`) have been successfully refactored. The goal is to move all remaining HTML generation to the `templates.js` file.
*   **Enhance Task Statistics:** Improve the dedicated Task Statistics page by adding more advanced analytics and visualizations, such as graphs for completion rates over time, to provide deeper insights into user performance.
*   **Unified Task Click Behavior:** Determine a consistent and intuitive behavior for clicking on tasks in the main Task Manager list, similar to the "Task View" modal that was implemented for the planner.
*   **Partial Miss Tracking:** For tasks that use a timer or a counter, enhance the miss tracking system to support partial completion. If a task is only 50% complete when it becomes overdue, it could be recorded as a "0.5 miss" instead of a full one, providing a more nuanced and fair reflection of the user's effort.
*   **Incremental Data Import:** Enhance the current import functionality. Instead of completely overwriting existing data, the app should provide an option to import *new* tasks and categories from a JSON file while keeping existing data intact. This is crucial for collaborative scenarios where a new set of tasks needs to be added to an existing workload.
*   **Bulk-Edit by Category:** In the Category Manager, add options to perform bulk actions on all tasks within a category. This could include deleting all tasks in that category, or clearing all *active* tasks while preserving the completed/missed history for statistical purposes.
*   **Task Data Migration Tool:** Create a tool that can seamlessly migrate user tasks from an old data format to the current one by prompting the user to map old data fields to new ones.
*   **Advanced calculateStatus Tuning:** Fine-tune the predictive logic for task statuses based on user feedback.
*   **Re-integrate "Today" Button:** The main calendar controls were simplified to a `Prev`/`Next` layout. A "Today" button, which was part of the default FullCalendar UI, should be re-integrated into the new custom header to provide quick navigation back to the current day.

### **ðŸš€ Future Roadmap: Database & Collaboration**

These are larger, long-term goals for the project that are dependent on migrating the application's backend from `localStorage` to a persistent, server-side database. For a detailed guide on the migration process itself, see [`DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`](./DATABASE_MIGRATION.md).

*   **Database Integration:** Transition from `localStorage` to a persistent, server-side database. This is the foundational step for all other items in this section.
*   **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts, a prerequisite for database integration and multi-user features.
*   **Multi-Device Sync:** Ensure seamless real-time data synchronization across all devices once the database is in place.
*   **Groups & Collaborative Task Management:** Implement a system for users to join groups (e.g., a company, a family). This would allow group owners to assign tasks to members, who would see those tasks in their own list.
*   **Task History & Analytics:** Build a comprehensive dashboard to visualize historical data on task completion and misses, providing deep insights into productivity trends over time.

### **ðŸ”© Ongoing Development**

To ensure the long-term health and stability of the application, the following principles should be followed during development.

*   **Continuous Refactoring:** As new features are added, prioritize clean code. If a component's HTML is generated in `js/script.js`, take the time to move it into a dedicated function in `js/templates.js`.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** For any new logical function (especially in `task-logic.js`), write tests *before* writing the function itself. This ensures correctness and prevents future regressions. The project is set up with Jest for this purpose.
