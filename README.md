# **Dynamic Task & Mission Planner**

Welcome to the Dynamic Task & Mission Planner, a powerful, highly customizable application designed to help you organize your life with intelligent, predictive scheduling and integrated planning. This app goes beyond a simple to-do list by analyzing your schedule, tracking your goals, and providing a clear visual interface to manage both your daily tasks and long-term missions.

## **In-Depth Features**

This application is built as a comprehensive tool for managing complex schedules and tracking progress towards specific goals. It combines a sophisticated task manager with a weekly mission planner, providing a single interface for all your planning needs.

### **The Task Manager**

The core of the application is a dynamic and intelligent task management system.

* **Intelligent Task Status:** Tasks automatically change color and status (Ready, Start Soon, Do Right Now, Overdue) based on a predictive algorithm. This system doesn't just look at the due date; it considers the estimated duration of all your other high-priority tasks to warn you about potential time crunches before they happen.  
* **Flexible Time Input:** Choose to define a task by its due date and time, or by its start time and estimated duration. The application will handle the calculations for you.  
* **Advanced Repetition Engine:** Create tasks that repeat on almost any schedule imaginable.  
  * **Relative Repetition:** Set tasks to repeat at an interval after their due date (e.g., "every 3 days").  
  * **Absolute Repetition:** Define complex schedules, such as "the last Friday of every month" or "the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of January, March, and May."  
* **Flexible Completion Tracking:** Choose how you want to complete a task.  
  * **Simple:** A standard check-off for simple to-do items.  
  * **Count-Based:** Track progress towards a numerical goal (e.g., read 50 pages, do 100 push-ups).  
  * **Time-Based:** Track time spent on a task with a built-in timer (e.g., study for 45 minutes).  
* **Habit & Failure Tracking:** For repeating tasks, you can set a "max misses" threshold. The task's status will change as you approach this limit, providing a clear visual indicator when a habit is at risk of being broken.  
* **In-Depth Customization:**  
  * **Task Icons:** Assign a unique icon to each task using Font Awesome classes for quick visual identification.  
  * **Customizable Task Cards:** From the Advanced Options menu, choose exactly which details you want to see on your task cards, such as due date, duration, category, and more.  
  * **Categories:** Create an unlimited number of color-coded categories to organize your tasks.  
  * **Status Names & Colors:** Edit the names and colors for each status (Ready, Overdue, etc.) to match your personal workflow.  
  * **Theming Engine:** Choose a base color to generate a dynamic, cohesive theme across the entire application, or stick with the default color scheme. You can also randomize the theme for a fresh look.  
* **Notifications:** Receive desktop notifications when a task's status changes, ensuring you never miss an important deadline. (Currently under development).

### **The Mission Planner**

Integrated directly with the task manager, the mission planner provides a high-level view of your week and long-term progress.

* **Seamless Task Creation:** Click directly on any time slot in the planner to instantly create a new one-hour task for that time.  
* **Repetition Projection:** Repeating tasks are automatically projected onto the planner, so you can see your future commitments at a glance.  
* **Historical View:** The planner maintains a 4-week history of completed and missed instances of your repeating tasks.  
* **Infinite Future View:** Scroll forward in the planner indefinitely in a read-only mode to see long-term projections.  
* **Weekly & Daily Views:** Plan your schedule on a traditional weekly grid or zoom in to a detailed daily view.  
* **Task Integration:** All tasks from the Task Manager with a due date will automatically appear on the planner grids.  
* **Custom KPIs:** Define and track your own Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Set daily goals and record your actual performance.  
* **5-Week Progress Tracker:** A visual chart tracks your performance on all your KPIs over the last five weeks.  
* **Amendment Tracking:** If you edit a past week's schedule, goals, or KPIs, the changes are flagged with an asterisk, ensuring an honest record.  
* **Seamless Week Advancement:** At the end of the week, a single click archives the current week and sets up a fresh week for planning.

## **Project Updates**

This section provides a high-level overview of the project's status, recent updates, and future plans.

### **âœ… Recently Completed (Version 1.5) - 09/20/2025**

This update focused on improving the long-term stability and maintainability of the application by addressing critical bugs and refactoring the planner's rendering engine.

*   **Planner View Rendering Overhaul:** Fixed a major visual bug in the **Weekly and Daily** planner views where concurrent tasks would overlap and become unreadable. The rendering logic was re-architected to use a modern **CSS Grid layout**. This replaces the old, brittle positioning logic with a robust system that correctly and automatically handles laying out tasks, ensuring the planner is stable and legible.
*   **Code Stability:** Refined the JavaScript rendering functions (`renderDailyView`, `renderWeeklyView`) to be simpler and more maintainable, directly supporting the new CSS Grid system.

### **ðŸ”œ Up Next: Future Updates**

The following features and fixes have been prioritized for upcoming releases.

#### **1. UI/UX Enhancements**

*   **Modernize Planner Views:**
    *   **Problem:** The current daily and weekly planners, while functional after the recent bug fixes, are built with custom code that can be complex to maintain. A more modern, library-based approach could offer more features and greater stability.
    *   **Objective:** Investigate and potentially implement a robust, pre-built calendar library like [FullCalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/) to replace the custom-built daily and weekly views. This would provide a more modern look and feel, better interactivity (like drag-and-drop), and reduce long-term maintenance.
*   **Planner Layout Reorganization:**
    *   **Problem:** The overall layout of the planner feels disconnected. The main week navigation is at the top, separated from the planner grid by the KPI section. Navigation controls are inconsistent between views (Weekly vs. Daily vs. Monthly).
    *   **Objective:** Redesign the HTML structure to create a more intuitive and cohesive user experience. This includes co-locating navigation with its relevant view and ensuring consistent controls across all planner views.
*   **Clickable Week Navigator:**
    *   **Problem:** User cannot easily jump to a specific week in the past or future without clicking the navigation buttons multiple times.
    *   **Objective:** Make the week date range display (`#weekDateRange`) clickable, opening a calendar widget that allows the user to select and jump to any week.
*   **Light Mode Theme Fix:**
    *   **Problem:** In light mode, some elements have dark text on a dark background, making them unreadable.
    *   **Objective:** Ensure all elements have light backgrounds and dark text in light mode.
    *   **Files to Edit:** `styles.css`
    *   **Elements:** `#prevWeekBtn`, `#nextWeekBtn`, `.kpi-indicator`, `#progressTrackerContainer`.
*   **KPI & Progress Tracker Updates:**
    *   **Problem:** KPI goals/actuals are not editable, and the system doesn't distinguish between daily and weekly KPIs.
    *   **Objective:** Make KPIs editable again and add a daily auto-task feature.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Editability:** In `renderProgressTracker()`, remove the `disabled` attribute from the `.kpi-goal-input` and `.kpi-actual-input` elements.
        2.  **Daily/Weekly Distinction:** Add a `frequency` property ('daily' or 'weekly') to KPI objects. Create a daily function to auto-generate tasks for all 'daily' KPIs.
*   **Advanced Options Accessibility:**
    *   **Problem:** The "Advanced Options" panel is only accessible from within the Task Manager modal.
    *   **Objective:** Add a button or link to the main planner interface to open the Advanced Options directly.

#### **2. Core Architecture: Task Archiving**

*   **Problem:** All tasks, active and completed, are stored in one array, which will become slow over time.
*   **Objective:** Move completed/missed tasks to a separate `historicalTasks` array to improve performance.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Data Structure:** Ensure `appState.historicalTasks` is saved to and loaded from localStorage.
    2.  **Modify Completion Logic:** In `confirmCompletionAction` and `confirmMissAction`, when a task is finished, move it from the main `tasks` array to the `historicalTasks` array. For repeating tasks, create a historical copy before updating the original task to its next due date.

### **ðŸš€ Future Roadmap**

These are larger, more long-term goals for the project.

* **Task History & Analytics:** Build a dashboard to visualize historical data on task completion and misses, providing insights into productivity trends.  
* **Database Integration:** Transition from localStorage to a persistent database like Firebase Firestore.  
* **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts.  
* **Multi-Device Sync:** Ensure seamless real-time data synchronization across all devices.  
* **Data Portability (Import/Export):** Implement features to import and export tasks and categories via JSON files.  
* **Advanced calculateStatus Tuning:** Fine-tune the predictive logic for task statuses based on user feedback.

### **ðŸ’¡ Community Suggestions**

A collection of great ideas suggested for future consideration.

* **Separate HTML templates:** The HTML for things like the task items is currently created inside the JavaScript. Moving this into separate template files would make the code cleaner and more organized.  
* **Implement a test suite:** The project doesn't currently have any automated tests. Adding a testing framework (like Jest or Mocha) would be a great way to ensure the application remains stable and bug-free as we add more features.  
* **Drag-and-drop:** Allowing you to drag and drop tasks to reschedule them on the planner would make it feel much more interactive and intuitive.  
* **Keyboard shortcuts:** Adding shortcuts for common actions (like creating a new task) could make the app faster to use.
