will you help me fix all these console problems? i think we need to completely revamp the way we go about fixing the font color because just putting it in the console is not useful to our users who most likely do not even know what a console is let alone how to access it and use it. and even if they could, how would they make any changes? without access to the files? no, this needs reworked big time. lets make this a css and js overhaul update of the text correction for background color manager.

there are 3 categories of background luminosities (brightness) and 2 categories of text color.
backgrounds:
light (white to mid gray)
dark (mid gray to black)
and clear

text colors:
white (relatively speaking as there are i think 4 levels between white and gray)
and black (again with the 4 levels)

so for each background that is found to be light, the theme manager needs to make the text black (or a variant of dark at least)
and for each dark background the font needs to be white (or a light variant)

and if it is clear it needs to look at the background behind that.

I am tempted to super duper simplify this okay?

so we have nearly a dozen colors made up by the theme manager when someone chooses a color, so lets make also a certain set of buttons (or at least certain types of buttons) so there are the primary main buttons, the secondary main buttons and the tertiary main buttons. that's it for main buttons. then there are the little buttons, these are all the clear ones.
so for now lets focus on streamlining the entire css and html so that there are only these 4 types of buttons... actually lets make a 5th kind for the red/green no/yes confirmation that i know appears somewhere. i like that. okay so we have these 5 kinds of buttons (technically 6 if you count the red/green as two)

do not allow there to be any buttons that are not one of these 6 styles. in fact lets even add a seventh style, we will call them, main small,

so of all these styles these are some examples of what will go where. but again there will be no buttons anywhere that are not one of these styles.

so for the primary main buttons, these are the 4 views
for the secondary buttons they will be the advanced options button... and that's it, it will be the same size as the primary ones too, just its on the other side of the page from them in the span tags, it is fine as is.
then there are the tertiary main buttons, which will be the add new task and new entry buttons, they will both share the size and shape of the current add new task button as i like this one better, and will not wrap.
then we will have the smaller primary main buttons, these are a little smaller and the same color as the main ones but they are just smaller and these are the next week previous week today buttons
then then we will have actually a third even slightly smaller primary main button that will be the day week month, as well as the previous today and next buttons on the KPI section of the dashboard.

then the clear buttons which are all over all the modals and menus throughout the app as well as the individual tasks of the task manager view has a lot of these too.

we need to decide what to do for crop down menu inputs as well as just all the other inputs and then we need to pick maybe 3 types of backgrounds and then just assign these to everything, just picking one of the three and then we only need the javascript to get the color in there from the theme but the css will and html will already be ready to receive it. so there should be a main background, a secondary main background and a modal background. so the main background will be the color most prevalent and in the main tag most likely or is it body? i can't remember. but anyway, it is the big one, then the secondary main will be an adjusted color of the main color and it will be the background for the different text box related kinds of things (and you can make the accent colors match for these too since i am seeing some subtle variations that make it more aesthetic and we definitely do not want to lose any of that with this update. we are merely trying to coordinate ALL of the classes so it is easier to update in the new theme manager we are building. i like how it chooses colors already and do not want to change those variables, simply how they are being applied. and once we have ALL of the backgrounds happening with this dynamic purposefully chosen set of colors, we can then also send off the correct font color with it. since the background color is changed via a class we can assign the color of the background to the class as well as the color of the font and the javascript will compile the correct font color to go with each background color before sending the background color off to the css. this will be calculated for luminosity and then paired up with the right font color (white or black) (or one of the lighter/darker shades as required unless you have a better idea here, maybe by applying a certain % opacity gray to the text to help it be dulled just a little from white or black to a little more gray? or maybe we would have a tag just for those fonts that need adjusted and then do the correct percentage of gray (15/30/45) depending on what was needed, can we just add gray overlayed overtop? because that would work like an absolute value almost where it wouldn't matter if it was white or black it would always bring it closer to gray which is what we need!

do you see what i am saying? this needs a major overhaul to the css and js and maybe html too to get it all working right and then we should not be adding in anything that is not controlled in this way using these types of templates so we stop having text font color visibility issues. first write everything i just did verbatim in the old readme and then go ahead and get to work and then when you are done add on top of what you pasted from me in the old readme what you did to solve this, be completely thorough. if everything is not changed to match it will look weird and not work. take all the time you need to completely revamp this part of the css. try to keep it aesthetically pleasing too if you can. you can deviate from what i said if you think it makes more sense visually :) thank you! <3 good luck! let me know if you have any questions or if i can be of help in anyway during this complete redoing brand new css (almost) again process.

## Solution Implemented: The New Dynamic Theme Engine

The previous system of styling was fragmented and relied on a combination of hardcoded colors, Tailwind CSS classes, and a JavaScript function that logged contrast warnings to the console instead of fixing them. This was not a scalable or user-friendly solution.

To address this, I have completely overhauled the application's styling architecture based on your vision. The new system is built on two core principles: **semantic CSS classes** and a **dynamic JavaScript theme engine**. This ensures that all UI elements are styled consistently and, most importantly, always have accessible color contrast.

### 1. Semantic, Theme-Agnostic CSS (`styles.css`)

-   **Structure, Not Style:** The main `styles.css` file has been refactored to be almost entirely "color-agnostic." It no longer contains hardcoded `color`, `background-color`, or `border-color` properties. Instead, it defines the **structure, layout, and size** of UI elements.
-   **New Class System:** I introduced a new, simplified, and semantic class system for common UI elements:
    -   **Buttons:** All buttons now use a base `.btn` class for common properties, combined with type and size classes.
        -   *Types:* `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-tertiary`, `.btn-confirm`, `.btn-deny`, `.btn-clear`
        -   *Sizes:* `.btn-lg`, `.btn-md`, `.btn-sm`, `.btn-xs`
    -   **Backgrounds:** Common background containers now use semantic classes: `.bg-main`, `.bg-secondary`, and `.bg-modal`.
-   **CSS Custom Properties:** All color information is now controlled by CSS Custom Properties (variables) like `--bg-main`, `--btn-primary-bg`, `--text-color-on-primary`, etc. These are defined and injected by the JavaScript theme engine.

### 2. Standardized HTML Structure (`index.html` & `js/templates.js`)

-   All old, presentational classes (e.g., `themed-button-primary`, `bg-gray-800`, `text-white`) have been systematically removed from `index.html` and all JavaScript template functions in `js/templates.js`.
-   They have been replaced with the new semantic classes (e.g., `<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">`). This makes the HTML cleaner and prepares it to receive the dynamic styles.

### 3. The JavaScript Theme Engine (`applyTheme` in `js/script.js`)

This is the heart of the new system. The `applyTheme` function was completely rewritten and now acts as a dynamic stylesheet generator.

-   **Dynamic Stylesheet Generation:** Instead of manipulating individual element styles (which is slow and error-prone), `applyTheme` now generates a complete CSS stylesheet as a block of text.
-   **Automatic Contrast Calculation:** For every single background color it generates (for buttons, modals, main content, etc.), it uses the `getContrastingTextColor` utility to calculate whether white or black text will provide the highest, most accessible contrast ratio. It then sets the `color` property for that class accordingly.
-   **Injection:** This dynamically generated stylesheet is injected into a `<style id="dynamic-theme-styles"></style>` tag in the document's `<head>`. The browser then applies these styles globally.

### How This Solves the Problem:

1.  **No More Console Warnings:** The `checkAllElementsContrast` function has been removed entirely. It is now obsolete because the new system **prevents contrast issues by design**, rather than just reporting them after the fact.
2.  **Guaranteed Accessibility:** Users can choose any color for their theme, and the system will *always* pair it with a text color that meets WCAG accessibility standards.
3.  **Consistency & Maintainability:** The entire look and feel of the application is now controlled from a single, logical place in the `applyTheme` function. Adding new themed elements or changing the look is now trivial and safe, as all colors and contrasts are handled automatically.

This new architecture is more robust, performant, and ensures a visually consistent and accessible experience for all users, regardless of their chosen theme.
